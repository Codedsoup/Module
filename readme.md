*NOTE: This is instructions for those who are coding with Python.
If your coding with Java or C, look down below, Thank you, you may proceed.*
If your coding with Python, you must create a directory called `src/com/codedsoup/module/`.
Inside that directory, create a file called **Module.py**. Copy the code from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedsoup/module/master/src/com/codedsoup/module/Module.py).
After copying it, you can edit **Module.py**.

If your coding with Java or C, don't create a file called **Module.py**.
If your coding with C, read these instructions:
- Create a directory in your project called `com/codedsoup/module`,
If your on github, have it `src/com/codedsoup/module`.
- Once the directory is made, make a file called **Module.c**.
Inside that file, copy the code from [here](http://codedsoup.com/module/c.txt).

If your coding with Java, read these instructions:
- Create a directory in your project called `com/codedsoup/module`,
If your on github, have it `src/com/codedsoup/module`.
- Once the directory is made, make a file called **Module.java**.
Inside that file, copy the code from [here](http://codedsoup.com/module/java.txt).
